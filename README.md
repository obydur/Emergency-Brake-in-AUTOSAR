Documentation for Implementing Cruise Control and Emergency Brake in AUTOSAR

Step 1 - Design Phase, SystemDesk
The design phase in SystemDesk involves specifying Software Components (SWCs), adding necessary ports, defining internal behaviors, and generating the Runtime Environment (RTE). Here's a breakdown of the process:

Tasks
Task 1: Setting up the simulation environment
Task Description:
The first task is to set up the simulation environment, where the VEOS simulator will interact with your system. Initially, the pedal states (AcceleratorPedal and BrakePedal) will be passed through to control the Accelerate and Brake signals.
